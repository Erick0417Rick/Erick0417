    <h2>What the hell is CSS?</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1]
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
    This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
    by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
